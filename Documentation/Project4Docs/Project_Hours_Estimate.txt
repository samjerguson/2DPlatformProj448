//Text file to store how long each member thinks the project will take in total

Benjamin Moeller - 45 hrs
Alec McGlynn - 30 hrs
Sam Jerguson - 40 hrs
Blake Richmeier - 40 hours

Average: 38.75 hrs

We reached this conclusion for the avereage number of hours by using a psuedo agile method where we analyzed
our past projects and how long each one took to complete. What we found was that each project usually took
about 30 - 40 hours in total per project, so that is why our average computed to be 38.75.
